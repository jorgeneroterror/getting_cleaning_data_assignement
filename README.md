We will work with one single script called run_analysis.R.

IMPORTANT! Before you run script you have to modify the 20th line. wd is a character variable who contains MY work directory path. YOU HAVE TO CHANGE THE PATH IN WD VARIABLE AND ADPAT IT TO YOUR WORK DIRECTORY PATH.

When you run the script it will create two folders.

* 1.- 'UCI HAR Dataset' which contains all the data with which the program is going to work 
* 2.- 'proyect' which contains one single file called 'averages.csv' which is a csv file with the average of each meassurement for each activity and suject. For more information read the codebook.md
